## Overview

Sinhala speakers have almost no native voice-AI assistant, because Sinhala is a confirmed low-resource language across speech recognition, transcription, and generation. This project closes that gap end-to-end: a user speaks (or types) a question in Sinhala, the system transcribes it, retrieves grounded facts from a real Sinhala knowledge base, generates a Sinhala answer, and speaks that answer back — all in one pipeline, deployed on free-tier infrastructure.

It was built as a research-grounded portfolio project: every design decision (model choice, corpus, fallback UX) is backed by a documented feasibility study rather than assumption, and every limitation of working with a low-resource language is measured and surfaced to the user instead of hidden.

## Key Features

- 🎤 **Voice-in, voice-out** — full spoken-question-to-spoken-answer loop, with a visible text-input fallback for reliability
- 📚 **Grounded, citable answers** — retrieval-augmented generation over a real Sinhala corpus (NSINA news + Sinhala Wikipedia), so the model answers from evidence instead of hallucinating
- 🗣️ **Natural Sinhala speech synthesis** — two neural Sinhala voices (`si-LK-ThiliniNeural`, `si-LK-SameeraNeural`) via `edge-tts`, free and keyless
- 📊 **Transparent confidence UX** — live STT confidence shown per query, with a "Did I hear that right?" retry prompt below a measured threshold
- 🧠 **Multi-turn conversation** — maintains context across follow-up questions instead of treating each query in isolation
- 🔤 **Singlish input detection** — recognizes romanized Sinhala typed in Latin script and routes it correctly
- 🔄 **Scheduled corpus refresh** — automated pipeline keeps the Sinhala news corpus current without manual re-ingestion
- 🛡️ **Documented content-safety layer** — conservative keyword/heuristic filter for Sinhala, built with explicit acknowledgment that robust Sinhala moderation is still an open research problem
- ✅ **Fully tested backend** — pytest + httpx test suite, CI pipeline on every push

## Why This Project Is Different

Most "low-resource language" demos quietly cherry-pick easy examples and never mention failure modes. This project runs the opposite way — a Phase 0 feasibility study measured real STT performance on Sinhala before any product code was written, and those numbers directly shaped the UX:

- Groq Whisper correctly identifies Sinhala and produces Sinhala Unicode output in all test cases, but word-level transcription confidence on clean audio averages well below what English pipelines typically achieve
- Rather than hide this, the UI surfaces per-query confidence, offers retry, and keeps text input always visible — never buried behind a mic-only interface
- The generation layer refuses to answer outside its retrieved context: if no relevant corpus chunk is found, it returns a fixed "I don't have information on this" response instead of a hallucinated one

This measure-first, document-honestly approach is the core engineering decision behind the whole project.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, ChromaDB, pytest, httpx
- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI/ML:** Groq Whisper large-v3 (STT), Google Gemini Flash (generation), `multilingual-e5-large` (embeddings), `edge-tts` (TTS)
- **Data:** NSINA Sinhala News Corpus, Sinhala Wikipedia (via HuggingFace Datasets)
- **Infra:** GitHub Actions (CI), Vercel (frontend hosting), Render (backend hosting)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Groq API key (free — [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com))
- Google Gemini API key (free — [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com))
- No other keys needed — `edge-tts` is keyless

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp ../.env.example ../.env   # add GROQ_API_KEY and GEMINI_API_KEY
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Corpus Ingestion

Run once before first use — pulls NSINA + Sinhala Wikipedia from HuggingFace:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/corpus/refresh
curl http://localhost:8000/api/corpus/status   # check progress
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd tests
python -m pytest test_api.py -v
```

## Data Sources

- **NSINA Sinhala News Corpus** — research-grade Sinhala news dataset (HuggingFace)
- **Sinhala Wikipedia** — `wikipedia` dataset, `si` config (HuggingFace)

Both datasets are freely available research releases; review their license terms before any use beyond a personal portfolio demo.

## Deployment

- **Backend → Render** (free tier): set `GROQ_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`, deploy `backend/` as a web service
- **Frontend → Vercel** (free tier): set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the deployed Render backend URL
- Render's free tier has cold-start delays (~30s), documented in the UI so first-query latency isn't mistaken for a bug

## Known Limitations

- Sinhala speech-to-text confidence trails English-grade pipelines — this is a documented, measured limitation of current STT models on low-resource languages, not a bug, and the UX is designed around it
- Sinhala offensive-language detection remains an unsolved research problem industry-wide; the built-in filter is intentionally conservative and not presented as a complete moderation solution
- `edge-tts` is an unofficial wrapper around Microsoft's Edge TTS service — free and reliable for a portfolio-scale demo, but not intended for production traffic at scale
